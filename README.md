# Pathfinder

Risk-aware, offline-friendly maps and routing tools for Sudanâ€“Chad
humanitarian operations. Pathfinder fuses fresh satellite imagery,
OpenStreetMap edits, and conflict-event data to publish daily safe-route
layers (GeoJSON, MBTiles, printable PDFs) for refugees, local drivers,
and aid convoys.
